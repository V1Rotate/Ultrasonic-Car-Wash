--- Technologies used ---

TypeScript, React, Redux, SCSS, ‘MockAPI’ for the Backend.

--- General Idea --- 

I was making my purchase at the Mcdonald's terminal recently (McDonald’s coffee is so good 😊… to me) and I was thinking of how nice it would be to develop 
an automated menu for a car wash. It would be cool to come for a car wash and order any service, like at the McDonald’s using terminal, select services, some 
other options you like, and order selected services as a package. This kind of menu might save the car wash operator’s time, and clients’ time, and make 
service ordering easier, especially in the ‘hot’ season or days when so many people lined up at the car wash.
Not a regular car wash, but with a ‘future technology’ - This project idea is a result of my imagination. Ultrasonic technologies are used in some industries, 
for some purposes, one of them is industrial cleaning used in metal fabrication, also, for instance, engine injectors used to be cleaned with ultrasonic 
technology and with some special equipment used. Ultrasonic technology provides unmatched deep cleaning of any spot of the material\item cleaned. However, 
ultrasonic technology has some points to consider and to know before it is used. It may not be used on some materials because of the risk of damaging the 
surface etc.

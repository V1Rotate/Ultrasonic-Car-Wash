# Ultrasonic-Car-Wash

Project DEMO: https://ultrasonic-carwash.netlify.app/

--- WHERE THE IDEA OF THE PROJECT CAME FROM ---

Being a creative thinker, I am willing to develop a project about something new, new to myself and to other people, however, 
about what is about most people interested or use. 

-Part 1: General Idea. 
I was making my purchase at McDonalds terminal recently (McDonaldâ€™s coffee is so good ðŸ˜Šâ€¦ to me) and I was thinking of how nice 
it would be to develop an automated menu for a car wash. It would be cool to come for a car wash and order any service, like at 
the McDonaldâ€™s using terminal, select services, some other options you like and order selected services as a package. This kind 
of menu might save the car wash operatorâ€™s time, clientsâ€™ time, make service ordering easier, especially in â€˜hotâ€™ season or days 
when so many people lined up to the car wash.

-Part 2: Not a regular car wash, but with a â€˜future technologyâ€™ ðŸ˜Š

As I mentioned, I like to image something newâ€¦ and this project idea is a result of my imagination.
Ultrasonic technologies used in some industries, for some purpose, one of them is industrial cleaning used in a metal fabrication, 
also, for instance, engine injectors used to be cleaned with an ultrasonic technology and with some special equipment used. Ultrasonic 
technology provides unmatched deep cleaning of any spot of the material\item cleaned. However, ultrasonic technology has some points 
to consider and to know before it is used. It may not be used on some materials because of a risk of damaging the surface etc. 

--- WEBSITE ---
So we have a car wash that provides a unique ultrasonic technology that provides an unmatched result. However, as it was mentioned above, 
because of some features and concerns, Ultrasonic cleaning procedure shall be selected\adjusted to every item which is going to be cleaned, 
a car, in our car. The reason is to select or adjust the procedure time and ultrasonic frequency and its strength to not to damage the car 
clearcoat, paint, glass, ceramic and rubber parts. 
So each Single Car Wash Procedure has options to be selected: Newer or Order car â€“ that should makes the system to adjust the ultrasonic 
strength, safe frequency and time for the best result.
Also, as it is automated menu and the Ultrasonic technology, as mentioned above, needs adjustments before its application to each car, a car 
size needs to be selected as well: Compact, Full-Size or Truck(Van). That might make add some more changes and adjustments, and change the 
car wash price accordingly.  

--- TECHNOLOGIES USED ---
TypeScript, React, Redux, SCSS, â€˜MockAPIâ€™ for Backend.
